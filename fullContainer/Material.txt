1) explain what docker is 
2) why is docker usefuly to our team (we can run applications self contained /easy reproducible environment)
3) run the nginx demo (first detach and then interactive)
3) show how we build a docker
4) show the samsung demo (cppcheck, gcovr, valgrind ->memory leak, fd track, uninitialized variables)

docker images are the application we want to run while containers are instance of the images (we can have multiple of them)
docker is a process with restricted resources, it is like saying run process A with filesystemA and 2 CPU's 
container run for as long as the application launches
containers use bridge networking or can use the host interface --net=host, you can use web server in one container and the database in another container
you can create multiple virtual networks and associate each docker with one network

docker version --> shows that this is client service
docker images -> shows the images you have
docker container ls -> shows the container that runs
docker stats -> looks at the statistic of conainer memory cpu 
docker inspect -> configuration of the docker


docker container run --publish 8080:80 --name web --detach --cpuset-cpus="0-1" nginx
docker container run -it nginx bash
